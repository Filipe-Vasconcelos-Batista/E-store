# Important!!

This project aims to develop a storefront application that I intend to complete in two or three phases. The first phase focuses on the front-end development, with the following objectives:

- To receive data from an API and display it on the web page
- To enable users to add products to their shopping cart and favorites list
- To use Pinia as the state management library
- To create a filter system that enhances the user experience
- To optimize the component design for reusability

The front-end design is flexible and adaptable to accommodate the future phases of the project.
The second phase will involve the back-end development, which will include:

- A method to input the products for sale in the store
- A user authentication system
- A realistic checkout process

If any of these features cannot be implemented in the second phase, the project will extend to a third phase.

Thank you for reading this
kind regards

# storefront

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup
